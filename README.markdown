# Imgur and Rails 
Clunky implementation of adding a URL to rails project.

## What is kinda does 
1. Takes a url and saves it to a rails project
2. Posts the url to imgur
3. Gets the response, parses for the newly created imgur url
4. Saves newly created imgur url to the rails project 

## What it doesn't do
Any validation or error handling, yet.
